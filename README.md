# osu!streamix
 osu!stream 2011 beta client, modified to look like stable

 ### if you have problems when runing
create a folder called "songs" in the bin debug folder and put beatmap folders there, if you have missing textures, copy them from the code to the bin skins folder
## IMPORTANT TODO:
- fix the circle hitbox, for some reason the whole cursor can hit it and not the exact center (ITS DUE TO THE HITBOX JUST BEING BIGGER THAN THE ACTUAL CIRCLE)
- fix ui and gameplay scaling
- add keyboard support
- add android support
## Less important to do
- private server support
- skinning support
- make the followpoints rotated
